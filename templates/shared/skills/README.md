# Skills

Skills are specialized knowledge guides that GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, and Codex can use to understand project-specific patterns and conventions.

## What are Skills?

Skills are markdown files with YAML frontmatter that provide domain-specific guidance. Unlike prompts (which are actions) or instructions (which are general guidelines), skills are **deep knowledge bases** for specific topics.

## Structure

Each skill lives in its own folder with a `SKILL.md` file. Following the
[`npx skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) standard, the real files
are installed **once** into a canonical `.agents/skills/` store, and each agent's
skills directory contains symlinks to it (single source of truth):

```text
.agents/skills/                       # canonical store (real files)
├── ai-seo-optimization/
│   └── SKILL.md
├── bitbucket-review-management/
│   └── SKILL.md
├── component-architecture/
│   └── SKILL.md
├── core-review/
│   └── SKILL.md
├── create-component/
│   └── SKILL.md
├── domain-driven-design/
│   └── SKILL.md
├── github-review-management/
│   └── SKILL.md
├── nextjs-caching/
│   └── SKILL.md
├── plugin-creation/
│   └── SKILL.md
├── quality-checks/
│   └── SKILL.md
├── release-management/
│   └── SKILL.md
├── stack-context/
│   └── SKILL.md
├── testing/
│   └── SKILL.md
├── testing-patterns/
│   └── SKILL.md
└── tsdoc-standards/
    └── SKILL.md

.github/skills/   → symlinks to ../../.agents/skills/*   (Copilot, Codex)
.claude/skills/   → symlinks to ../../.agents/skills/*   (Claude Code, read natively)
```

Use `--copy` at install time to materialize real copies instead of symlinks
(symlinks also fall back to copies automatically on systems that don't support them).

## Frontmatter Format

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: When to use this skill. Agents use this to decide relevance.
---
```

## Available Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `ai-seo-optimization` | Optimize sites for Google generative AI features, agent-friendly HTML, E-E-A-T signals |
| `bitbucket-review-management` | Create, review, comment on, resolve & merge Bitbucket PRs via the `twg` CLI |
| `component-architecture` | React component patterns, folder structure, naming conventions |
| `core-review` | Pre-review pass (before a PR / before pushing review fixes) run read-only — inline or via `@core-review` on Copilot, optionally a subagent on Claude Code — to preempt reviewer iterations. Forge-agnostic: invoked by `create-pr` (Jira/Bitbucket) and `create-github-pr` alike |
| `create-component` | Scaffold a new component in a Silver Assist WordPress plugin (LoadableInterface pattern) |
| `domain-driven-design` | DDD principles, domain organization, barrel exports |
| `github-review-management` | Fetch, reply to, resolve & close GitHub PR review threads via `gh` CLI + GraphQL |
| `nextjs-caching` | Next.js caching strategy: read-vs-mutation fetch, ISR tiers, CDN invalidation, dynamic-render diagnosis |
| `plugin-creation` | Scaffold a new Silver Assist WordPress plugin from scratch (PSR-4, LoadableInterface, CI/CD) |
| `quality-checks` | Run PHPCS, PHPStan (level 8), and PHPUnit for Silver Assist WordPress plugins |
| `release-management` | Create and manage releases for Silver Assist WordPress plugins (unified build + GH Actions) |
| `stack-context` | Inventory the project's exact Next.js/React/Tailwind/shadcn versions, flag npm registry gaps, and research what shipped in newer Next.js/React versions so suggestions use current APIs |
| `testing` | Write and run PHPUnit tests for Silver Assist WordPress plugins (WP_UnitTestCase) |
| `testing-patterns` | Jest + RTL patterns for Next.js 15 and Server Actions |
| `tsdoc-standards` | Write & enforce TSDoc (not JSDoc): allowed tags, forbidden JSDoc patterns, templates |

## Usage

Skills are automatically picked up by agents when relevant to your question. You can also reference them explicitly:

```text
@workspace Use the component-architecture skill to create a new payment form component
```

## Creating Custom Skills

1. Create a folder: `.agents/skills/your-skill-name/` (canonical store)
2. Create `SKILL.md` with frontmatter
3. Run `npx @silverassist/agents-toolkit install --skills-only` to symlink it into `.github/skills/` and `.claude/skills/`
4. Document patterns, examples, and conventions
5. Include ✅ CORRECT and ❌ INCORRECT examples
