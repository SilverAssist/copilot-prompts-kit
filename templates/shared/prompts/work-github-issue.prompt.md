# Work on GitHub Issue

> **Model:** Smart tier — `Claude Sonnet 5` on Copilot, `sonnet` on Claude Code (implementation orchestration). To change it, edit the `model:` line in this file's frontmatter; the pin wins over the Copilot picker and Claude `/model`. Codex ignores `model:` — set the session model with `codex --model`.

Start working on GitHub issue **#{issue-number}** in repository **{owner}/{repo}** with complete workflow setup.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub MCP connection or `gh` CLI required
- Reference: `.github/prompts/_partials/github-integration.md`
- Reference: `.github/prompts/_partials/git-operations.md`

## Steps

### 1. Read Complete Issue

Fetch issue **#{issue-number}** with all details:

- Title and description
- Labels and priority
- Current state
- All comments for context
- Acceptance criteria

### 2. Analyze Project Context

Read project conventions:

- `AGENTS.md` — Agent instructions (Copilot/Codex)
- `CLAUDE.md` — Agent instructions (Claude Code)
- `copilot-instructions.md` or `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — Project guidelines
- `.github/instructions/` — File-type specific instructions
- `docs/` — Related documentation

### 3. Detect Stack Context

If this is a Next.js/React project (`package.json` present with `next` or `react`), run the
**`stack-context` skill** (`.agents/skills/stack-context/SKILL.md`). It reports the exact
installed `next`/`react`/Tailwind/shadcn versions, flags registry gaps, and — when a framework
package is behind — summarizes what shipped in between, so the plan in Step 5 uses current APIs
and calls out any relevant upgrade or new capability instead of defaulting to stale patterns.
Skip this step entirely on a WordPress project.

### 4. Analyze Technical Impact

Search codebase for:

- Related components
- Existing patterns
- Files to modify
- Dependencies

### 5. Create Work Plan

Create planning document at `docs/{feature-name}-plan.md`.

**Its first line must be the removal marker**, exactly:

```markdown
<!-- agents-toolkit:planning-doc issue={issue-number} -->
```

`create-github-pr` deletes the plan at PR time by grepping for this marker, and deletes
**nothing** without it — a plan written without the marker survives into the base branch. The
marker, not the filename, is what identifies the file as temporary, so a legitimate deliverable
like `docs/rollout-plan.md` is never at risk.

Then the body:

- Problem statement
- Current architecture
- Proposed changes
- Phase breakdown
- Testing strategy

### 6. Create Working Branch

From latest `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/{issue-number}-short-description
# or for bugs:
git checkout -b fix/{issue-number}-short-description
```

### 7. Initial Commit

```bash
git add docs/{feature-name}-plan.md
git commit -m "docs: Add implementation plan for #{issue-number}"
```

### 8. Update GitHub Issue

Add comment to the issue:

```markdown
## Development Started
- Branch: `feature/{issue-number}-description`
- Plan: `docs/{feature-name}-plan.md`

## Phases
- [ ] Phase 1: ...
- [ ] Phase 2: ...
```

## Output

Report:

1. ✅ Issue summary
2. ✅ Branch created
3. ✅ Planning document created
4. ✅ Ready to start implementation

## Next Steps

- Begin implementation following the plan
- Use `@core-review` with **`--budget quick`** (if installed) for cheap-tier consistency checks during development — pass the changed-file list in the brief (the agent has no shell and cannot run `git diff` itself)
- Use `prepare-pr` when ready for review
- Use `create-github-pr` to submit pull request
