# Quick Code Review

> **Model:** Cheap tier — `Claude Haiku 4.5` on Copilot, `haiku` on Claude Code (a deterministic checklist). To change it, edit the `model:` line in this file's frontmatter; the pin wins over the Copilot picker and Claude `/model`. Codex ignores `model:` — set the session model with `codex --model`.

Perform a quick code review of the current changes.

## Steps

### 1. Get Changed Files

```bash
git diff --name-only HEAD~1
# or for unstaged changes:
git diff --name-only
```

### 2. Detect Stack Context

If this is a Next.js/React project (`package.json` present with `next` or `react`), run the
**`stack-context` skill** (`.agents/skills/stack-context/SKILL.md`). Use its output to flag
patterns in the changed files that are stale for the version actually installed (e.g. Pages
Router idioms in an App Router project) and to feed the 💡 Suggestions section below with any
new capability the changed files could adopt. Skip this step entirely on a WordPress project.

### 3. Review Each File

For each changed file:

#### Code Quality

- [ ] No `console.log` or debug statements
- [ ] No `any` types
- [ ] No hardcoded values (use constants)
- [ ] No commented-out code

#### Style & Conventions

- [ ] Follows project naming conventions
- [ ] Imports organized alphabetically
- [ ] Proper TypeScript types
- [ ] Consistent formatting

#### Logic

- [ ] No nested ternaries
- [ ] Early returns used appropriately
- [ ] Error handling in place
- [ ] Edge cases considered

#### Documentation

- [ ] JSDoc on new functions
- [ ] Complex logic has comments
- [ ] Props interfaces documented

### 4. Security Check

- [ ] No sensitive data (API keys, secrets)
- [ ] No exposed credentials
- [ ] No unsafe user input handling

### 5. Performance

- [ ] No unnecessary re-renders (React)
- [ ] Efficient data structures
- [ ] No memory leaks potential

### 6. Caching & Data Fetching (Next.js)

> See `.github/instructions/caching.instructions.md`. Caching is decided by **read-vs-mutation**, not the HTTP method.

- [ ] Reads cache regardless of method — a `POST` read (e.g. `geo-search`) sets `next: { revalidate, tags }` (NOT `revalidate: 0`)
- [ ] No `next: method === "GET" ? {...} : { revalidate: 0 }` gating (leaves POST reads uncached → route turns dynamic, `private, no-store`)
- [ ] Mutations (`submit`/lead/`PUT`/`DELETE`) use `cache: "no-store"` and are never cached
- [ ] `tags` always paired with a `revalidate` duration (no bare `next: { tags }`)
- [ ] Cacheable routes export `revalidate`; not added to form/personalized routes
- [ ] `React.cache()` not used as a substitute for cross-request caching
- [ ] On-demand revalidation invalidates both Next.js (`revalidateTag`/`revalidatePath`) and the CDN
- [ ] A dynamic route (`[slug]`-style) exports `revalidate` AND has a `generateStaticParams` (even
      `return []`) — `revalidate` alone is a silent no-op without it
- [ ] Data fetchers return a discriminated union (`found`/`not_found`/`incomplete`/`api_error`), not
      `T | null` — a collapsed error gets cached as a permanent 404
- [ ] Any CDN/edge cache override (e.g. `proxy.ts`) checks `response.status` before applying a public
      cache, or is only applied to routes that provably can't throw
- [ ] No `loading.tsx` sits as an ancestor of a route that calls `notFound()` — verify with a status
      check (`curl -sv`), not just that the UI looks right

### 7. Component Architecture (React/Next.js)

> See `.github/instructions/react-components.instructions.md`.

- [ ] Components use `export default function`, not a named export
- [ ] Each file exports exactly one component — a desktop/mobile pair or a set of small related
      variants (e.g. skeleton loaders) still gets one folder each, not one file with multiple exports
- [ ] Folder is kebab-case with an `index.tsx`, props interface defined in the same file
- [ ] Domain barrel (`index.ts`) re-exports new components with a named alias
- [ ] No inline `<script type="application/ld+json" dangerouslySetInnerHTML>` — structured data goes
      through a shared `<JsonLD>`-style component
