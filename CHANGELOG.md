## [2.10.0] - 2026-09-09

### Added

- **`stack-context` skill** (react stack) — reads the exact installed `next`/`react`/`typescript`/`tailwindcss`/`@radix-ui`/shadcn/`@silverassist/*` versions from `package.json` and the lockfile, flags npm registry gaps, and — when `next` or `react` itself is behind by a minor or major version — researches what shipped in between (GitHub releases/blog posts) so a suggestion uses current APIs instead of stale or Pages-Router-era patterns pulled from training data. Read-only: it never runs `npm install`/`update`. Caches registry/research results in `.agents-toolkit-stack-context.json` (12h TTL) to avoid re-hitting the registry on every invocation. Wired as the first step of `analyze-ticket`, `analyze-github-issue`, `work-ticket`, `work-github-issue`, `create-plan`, `review-code`, `fix-issues`, `add-tests`, and `prepare-pr`.

### Fixed

- **`src/index.ts`'s `VERSION` constant had drifted to `2.8.1`** while `package.json` moved on to `2.9.0` — this is the exact field `install`/`restore`/`status` compare against the lockfile to warn "you're on an old version of the toolkit, run update," so that warning has been silently non-functional since the 2.9.0 release. Re-synced, and a new test now asserts `dist/index.mjs`'s `VERSION` matches `package.json` on every run.
- **`SKILLS` and `PARTIALS` (the public `dist/index.mjs` exports) were missing `bitbucket-review-management` and `bitbucket-integration`** — both shipped as real files in 2.9.0 but never added to the arrays that describe the package's own content to an external consumer. New tests assert these arrays (plus `INSTRUCTIONS` and `PROMPTS`) match the actual template files on disk, so this class of drift fails CI instead of shipping quietly.
- **`--partials-only` installed every prompt file, not just `_partials/`**, in both the Copilot/Codex and Claude installers — contradicting its own help text and the README. `getInstallScope` had folded it into the same branch as `--prompts-only`; split into a distinct `shouldInstallPrompts` / `shouldInstallPartials` pair so the two flags are no longer aliases of each other.
- The `core-review` skill's README row undercounted where it's wired in ("`create-pr` and `create-github-pr` alike") — it's actually 4 callers, also `resolve-github-reviews` and `finalize-github-pr`.

### Notes

- All four fixes above came out of a deep, whole-repo `/core-review` pass run specifically ahead of this release (not tied to a feature diff) — worth doing again before future releases, since none of these would surface from reviewing any single PR's diff in isolation.

## [2.9.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- **Bitbucket is now driven from the terminal, like GitHub always was.** `create-pr` and `finalize-pr` described the PR *content* but never opened or merged anything — the Jira tracker workflow ended with a human clicking through the Bitbucket UI, while the GitHub track had `gh` wired end to end. Both prompts now call the **TWG CLI** (`twg bb`): `create-pr` opens the PR with `twg bb prs create --description-file`, and `finalize-pr` reads status and review comments, replies, resolves threads, and merges with `twg bb prs merge`. Merging is gated on explicit user confirmation.
- **`bitbucket-integration.md` partial** — the Bitbucket counterpart to `github-integration.md`: PR create/read/comment/approve/merge, repo and file reads without cloning, branch operations, and pipeline debugging. Installed with the `jira` tracker.
- **`bitbucket-review-management` skill** — the counterpart to `github-review-management`: the reply → resolve → verify loop, inline comment anchoring, merge strategies, and failing-pipeline triage. Installed with the `jira` tracker.
- **Ticketless PRs are a supported path in the Jira track.** `create-pr` used to hard-stop when `{ticket-id}` was still a placeholder, and both prompts treated the Jira comment and transition as mandatory — so a `docs/*` or `chore/*` branch, which legitimately has no ticket, could not be finished without inventing one. Both prompts now derive the ticket from the branch name (`[A-Z][A-Z0-9]+-[0-9]+`) and skip every Jira step when there is none, reporting the skip explicitly instead of leaving a checklist line ambiguous. The Jira steps are also non-blocking when a ticket *is* present: a failed comment or a forbidden transition is reported, never a reason to stop — the PR or the merge is the deliverable, the Jira update is bookkeeping.
  - Detection keys off the **ticket-ID pattern, not a branch-prefix list**: a prefix list fails closed on every prefix nobody enumerated (`refactor/`, `ci/`, `release/`, `spike/`), while the pattern handles them all. The prefix check stays where it belongs, as the separate "does this branch follow convention" step.
  - No project-key alternation is hardcoded. `.agents-toolkit.json` already carries `jira.projectKey` per repo, and baking a fixed set into a shared toolkit would mean a release every time a new key appears — there are already more in circulation than any short list would cover. A key that differs from the configured one is a **warning, not a failure**.
  - An explicit `{ticket-id}` argument that disagrees with the branch stops and asks: that mismatch almost always means the wrong branch is checked out, and guessing writes a comment on the wrong ticket.
- **`docs/cli-setup.md`** — developer setup for both CLIs: install commands per platform, authentication, verification, and the gotchas. `README.md`'s Requirements section now names both.

### Notes

- **`twg bb` needs a Bitbucket token that `twg login` does not create.** OAuth login covers Jira and Confluence; Bitbucket is a separate credential added by `twg setup bitbucket`. Skipping it produces a working `twg whoami` and a failing `twg bb` — documented in every asset above, because the symptom reads like a permissions problem and is not.
- **The prompts degrade instead of stopping.** With no CLI they still push the branch and hand the user the title, the description file, and a create-PR URL. What they must not do is report "no Bitbucket access" without checking first: `twg` authenticates from its own saved profile in `~/.config/twg/`, so an empty environment proves nothing. This exact mistake left a finished branch unopened in a real session while the CLI to open it was installed the whole time.
- **Read PRs with `-o json`.** `twg bb prs get` in text mode prints the payload twice — the description raw and again as rendered HTML — which measured 62 KB on an ordinary docs PR against ~600 bytes for the CLI's compact agent view. Both new assets say so; an agent that dumps the raw payload burns its context for no added information.
- Atlassian's installation docs currently say `twg upgrade`; that command does not exist in the shipped CLI (verified on 1.2.7). `docs/cli-setup.md` documents `twg update`.
- The partials indexes in `templates/shared/prompts/_partials/README.md` and `templates/shared/prompts/README.md` were both missing `github-integration.md`, `release-node.md` and `release-wordpress.md`. Adding the Bitbucket row re-presented them as complete, so the pre-existing omissions were filled in too.
- `docs/` is now published with the package (`package.json` `files`), so the README's link to the CLI setup guide resolves for anyone who installs it rather than only on GitHub.
- README's three "13 skills total" counts are now 14.

## [2.8.2] - 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- **TypeScript major bumps broke `npm install` on release day** — `typescript-eslint` doesn't support a new TS major until some time after it ships, causing an ERESOLVE peer-dependency conflict (hit on the TS 6.0.3 bump). Added a Dependabot ignore rule for TypeScript major bumps, matching the fix already applied in `icons` (upstream: typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint#10940).
- Corrected stale claims in the 2.7.0 CHANGELOG entry.

### Changed

- Standardized Dependabot auto-merge and `engines` config.
- Publish workflow now runs on Node 24, so npm 11.x ships natively.

## [2.8.1] - 2026-08-20

### Changed

- **npm publishing moved to trusted publishing (OIDC)** ([#66](https://github.com/SilverAssist/agents-toolkit/issues/66)). `publish.yml` no longer reads an `NPM_TOKEN` secret: it requests `id-token: write` and npm exchanges that OIDC token for publish rights against the trusted publisher registered for this package. The long-lived token failed two consecutive attempts on the v2.8.0 release — first `E404` (expired; npm returns 404 rather than 403 on auth failures so it does not leak package existence), then `EOTP` (a classic *Publish* token, which unlike an *Automation* token does not bypass 2FA) — and the granular token that finally worked expires 2026-11-18. npm's own token form now recommends trusted publishing for CI. A step upgrading npm to `latest` was added because Node 22 ships npm 10.x and trusted publishing requires >= 11.5.1. Since the repo and package are both public, publishing over OIDC also attests provenance automatically, which token publishing does not.

## [2.8.0] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- **`create-pr` (Jira/Bitbucket flow) now runs the pre-PR core review** ([#63](https://github.com/SilverAssist/agents-toolkit/issues/63)). `f505f8e` (#36) wired the `core-review` pass into `create-github-pr`, `finalize-github-pr` and `resolve-github-reviews` but never touched `create-pr.prompt.md`, so every repo on the Jira/Bitbucket flow (`senioradvicecom-nextjs`, `assistedliving-nextjs`, `family-nextjs`, …) opened PRs with no consistency pass at all — `prepare-pr` only runs lint/type-check/tests plus a manual checklist. Step 5 is now **Pre-PR core review**: the planning-doc removal stays as 5.1, the `--budget medium` review runs as 5.2, and the commit-and-verify block is 5.3. Ordering is load-bearing and now asserted by a test — reviewing after the removal is what catches references the removal left stale. The original step was motivated by preempting *Copilot* review iterations, which is why the Jira flow was skipped; the pass itself is local and agent-side (doc↔code drift, invalid examples, broken links, stale indexes) and never touches a forge API, so on Bitbucket it saves a human reviewer the same round-trip.
- **`core-review` skill is no longer filtered out of `--tracker jira` installs** ([#63](https://github.com/SilverAssist/agents-toolkit/issues/63)). It was listed under `skills.github` in `FILE_CATEGORIES`, so `shouldIncludeFile` excluded it from every Jira-tracker install — meaning the fix above would have shipped those projects a prompt referencing a skill they never received. It now resolves as `universal` for all trackers. `github-review-management`, which does drive the GitHub review API, stays github-scoped.
- **`core-review` documentation no longer describes itself as GitHub-only** ([#63](https://github.com/SilverAssist/agents-toolkit/issues/63)). `SKILL.md` carried a blockquote stating outright that the Jira-tracker variants do not invoke the skill, plus four caller lists that named only the GitHub orchestrators — all stale the moment `create-pr` started wiring it. Propagated through `SKILL.md`, the asset maps in `AGENTS.md` and `AGENTS.codex.md`, the skills README row, and the README skills table. Those descriptions also still called the pass "whole-repo", which `--budget` (2.7.0) superseded; they now say the scope follows `--budget`. `finalize-pr` remains the one orchestrator that does not wire the skill.

### Added

- **Caching and component-architecture skills/instructions updated from a 2026-08 fleet-wide incident** (WEB-1142, 9 Silver Side Next.js repos audited and fixed): `nextjs-caching` skill and `caching.instructions.md` gain the `notFound()` → HTTP 200 gotcha (an ancestor `loading.tsx` locks the response status before a `notFound()` check resolves), the discriminated-union data-fetching pattern (`found`/`not_found`/`incomplete`/`api_error` instead of `T | null`, so a transient upstream error can't get cached as a permanent 404), an explicit status-blindness warning on the CDN/edge-override caching strategy, and a new preferred strategy — native ISR via `generateStaticParams() { return [] }`, which unlocks per-status caching on a dynamic segment with zero pages pre-built at compile time. `component-architecture` skill and `react-components.instructions.md` gain a "one component per file" rule (found violated independently in 6+ repos) and the `<JsonLD>` shared-component pattern for structured data (found duplicated inline in every repo audited, plus a required-`data`-prop bug found in three forks of one template). `domain-driven-design` skill gains a generic rule: a resolver calling a framework navigation primitive (`notFound()`, `redirect()`) belongs colocated with its route, not in `lib/`. `review-code.prompt.md`'s caching checklist and a new Component Architecture checklist section cover the same findings at review time.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-08-03

Cheap-first model-tier discipline on Copilot and Claude Code ([#39](https://github.com/SilverAssist/agents-toolkit/issues/39)). Every shipped prompt and the `core-review` skill carry a **hardcoded** `model:` pin: mechanical work runs on the cheap tier, design work on the smart tier. There is no tier configuration, no CLI flag, and nothing resolved at install time — to change a tier you edit the `model:` line in the installed file. (Codex ignores `model:` pins entirely; control the session tier with `codex --model`.)

**Why no configuration surface.** An earlier draft of this release shipped a `models` block in `.agents-toolkit.json`, a `--model-pins {on,off}` flag, and install-time frontmatter rewriting for Copilot and skills. It was removed before merge: a model-selection layer spanning three agents whose catalogues move independently costs more to maintain than it saves, and it made the shipped documentation wrong in a way that was not obvious (the docs said "reinstall to apply", but `install` skips files that already exist — only `update` overwrites). Pins in files, documented, are the whole mechanism.

### Added

- **`tools:` allowlist on all 19 shipped prompts** ([#42](https://github.com/SilverAssist/agents-toolkit/issues/42)) — every prompt now declares a `tools:` frontmatter block scoping it to only the tools its body actually uses. This restricts which MCP server schemas VS Code sends to the model on each turn. Prompts that talk to the GitHub MCP include `github/*`; Atlassian/Jira prompts include `atlassian/*`; read-only audit prompts (`audit-ai-seo`) declare only `read_file` and `grep_search`; `review-code` adds `run_in_terminal` for `git diff`. `tools:` is Copilot-only: the Claude installer strips it when converting to Claude commands, and `allowed-tools` on Claude Code is a permission pre-approval that does not reduce context.
- **`tools:` is now a required frontmatter key** ([#42](https://github.com/SilverAssist/agents-toolkit/issues/42)) — `scripts/validate-prompts.mjs` enforces presence of a non-empty `tools:` list on every prompt template. Existing `validate:prompts` + new tests in `src/validate-prompts.test.js` and `src/cli.test.js` gate this.
- **MCP wildcard portability documented** ([#42](https://github.com/SilverAssist/agents-toolkit/issues/42)) — `templates/shared/prompts/README.md` explains that `github/*` and `atlassian/*` resolve only when the respective server is registered under those exact names in `mcp.json`, and how to adjust for non-default server names.
- **Explicit `model:` pin on all 19 shipped prompts**, written as a single scalar value plus a `**Model:**` header line under each H1 explaining the tier and how to change it.
  - **Cheap tier** — `Claude Haiku 4.5` on 13 checklist/mechanical prompts: `add-tests`, `analyze-github-issue`, `analyze-ticket`, `audit-ai-seo`, `finalize-github-pr`, `finalize-pr`, `fix-issues`, `new-wp-component`, `new-wp-plugin`, `prepare-github-release`, `prepare-pr`, `quality-check`, `review-code`.
  - **Smart tier** — `Claude Sonnet 5` on the 6 orchestrator/design prompts: `create-plan`, `work-ticket`, `work-github-issue`, `create-pr`, `create-github-pr`, `resolve-github-reviews`.
- **Claude Code installer remaps the pin to a Claude alias.** `installClaude` rewrites `Claude Haiku 4.5` → `model: haiku` and `Claude Sonnet 5` → `model: sonnet` (also `opus`, `fable`), because a Copilot vendor-qualified name means nothing to Claude Code. Aliases rather than pinned version IDs, so they track the current generation without maintenance. A non-Claude pin installs with no frontmatter at all, leaving Claude on the session model. New `extractClaudeAlias` + `transformFrontmatterForClaude` helpers replace the previous whole-frontmatter strip.
- **`Explore` cheap-tier subagent override for Claude Code** — `templates/shared/agents/Explore.md` ships with `model: haiku` and installs to `.claude/agents/`, overriding Claude's built-in `Explore`. It is read-only and runs during nearly every autonomous cycle, so pinning it cheap stops the parent's smart tier from being inherited into every exploration turn. Suppress with `--no-agent-overrides`.
- **`core-review` skill gains `model: haiku` and a `--budget {quick,medium,thorough}` argument** — `quick` is the diff plus directly-touched files, `medium` adds one-hop neighbours, `thorough` is the whole repo. The cheap tier is safe at every budget: `thorough` widens the file set, not the reasoning depth. Orchestrators pass an explicit budget (`create-github-pr` → `medium`, `finalize-github-pr` and `resolve-github-reviews` → `quick`).
- **`core-review.agent.md` Copilot subagent override** ([#43](https://github.com/SilverAssist/agents-toolkit/issues/43)) — `templates/shared/agents/core-review.agent.md` ships a custom agent pinned to `Claude Haiku 4.5` and installs to `.github/agents/`. Custom agents establish their own `model:` boundary on Copilot (unlike skills, which inherit the invoking prompt's model), so the cheap tier is honoured when no explicit invocation model is supplied, even when the agent is invoked inline from a smart-tier orchestrator. The agent is read-only (`tools: ['read', 'search']`) and `user-invocable: true` — it appears in the chat picker and can be directly @-mentioned as `@core-review`. Suppress with `--no-agent-overrides`.
- **`--no-agent-overrides` now also skips `.github/agents/`** ([#43](https://github.com/SilverAssist/agents-toolkit/issues/43)) — the flag previously only affected `.claude/agents/` (Claude Code). It now covers both directories; help text updated accordingly.
- **`AGENTS` export updated to `['Explore', 'core-review']`** ([#43](https://github.com/SilverAssist/agents-toolkit/issues/43)) — `src/index.js` lists the shipped subagent overrides for all agents.
- **Subagent escape hatch documented in all four root docs and prompts README** ([#43](https://github.com/SilverAssist/agents-toolkit/issues/43)) — the "skills inherit the invoking prompt's model — use a standalone chat" guidance is extended: custom agents establish their own model boundary, so `@core-review` gives a cheap-pinned inline pass without requiring a separate chat session. `AGENTS.codex.md` adds the note that `.agent.md` `model:` is inert on Codex too (same as `model:` on prompts).
- **"Model-tier discipline" section in all four root docs** (`AGENTS.md`, `AGENTS.codex.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `copilot-instructions.md`) and a tier table in `templates/shared/prompts/README.md`, each documenting the per-platform reality rather than a single invariant.

### Changed

- **`engines.node` raised to `>=22.0.0`** ([#50](https://github.com/SilverAssist/agents-toolkit/issues/50)). Node 18 reached End of Life in April 2025; the floor is now Node 22 (Maintenance LTS). CI compat matrix drops Node 18, adds Node 24 for early deprecation detection. This unblocks `lint-staged@17+` which requires `node >=22.22.1`.
- **`model:` is a single scalar, not a prioritized array.** The array form is undocumented for `.prompt.md` files — [the VS Code reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/agent-customization/prompt-files) describes `model` as "the language model used when running the prompt" — and GitHub Copilot CLI rejects it outright (`model: Expected string, received array`, [copilot-cli#2133](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/2133)). Had VS Code ignored the array, every prompt would have silently fallen back to the picker and the entire optimization would have been a no-op. The toolkit therefore ships no fallback chains: an unavailable pin falls back to the agent's own default.
- **Smart tier is `Claude Sonnet 5`, not `Claude Sonnet 4.5`.** Per [GitHub's published pricing](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/copilot-billing/models-and-pricing), Sonnet 5 costs $2/$10 per million input/output tokens against Sonnet 4.5's $3/$15 — newer *and* 33% cheaper, so the older pin was strictly dominated.
- **Dropped `GPT-5` and `GPT-5.5` as smart-tier fallbacks.** `GPT-5` is no longer in the [supported-models catalogue](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/ai-models/supported-models) at all, and `GPT-5.5` ($5/$30) is among the most expensive models available — 2.5× the input and 3× the output of Sonnet 5, which is a strange thing to put in a cost-optimization release.
- **Codex keeps the `model:` field even though it ignores it.** Codex has no per-prompt model concept, and its installer copies the same shared templates into the same `.github/prompts/` directory Copilot installs to — so the pin Copilot needs is present in the files Codex reads. Stripping it for Codex would mean adding an install-time frontmatter transform (the mechanism already used to rewrite pins for Claude) purely to suppress an editor lint warning; that was judged not worth the extra target-specific code path. Leaving the field produces a non-blocking warning and nothing else. This is documented in `AGENTS.codex.md` so the warning is not mistaken for a defect.
- **`showHelp()`** advertises `--no-agent-overrides`.

### Fixed

- **Planning-doc removal is now marker-based and cannot delete a deliverable.** The step shipped in `create-pr.prompt.md` and `create-github-pr.prompt.md` matched `docs/*plan*.md` — a **substring** pattern that also matches `explanation.md` (ex-**plan**-ation) and `planet.md`. Tightening it to the `-plan.md` **suffix** was not enough either: `docs/rollout-plan.md` is a perfectly ordinary deliverable. No filename pattern can distinguish a generated plan from a real document, so the generators (`work-ticket`, `work-github-issue`, `create-plan`) now write a marker as the plan's first line — `<!-- agents-toolkit:planning-doc … -->` — and the removal deletes only files carrying it. A plan written without the marker is **not** deleted: leaving one behind is a trivial cleanup, whereas deleting someone's deliverable is not recoverable from the PR.
- **Planning-doc removal no longer aborts on paths containing spaces.** The same step collected paths into a newline-delimited variable and piped it to `xargs git rm`, which word-splits: a doc named `my feature-plan.md` produced `fatal: pathspec 'docs/my' did not match any files` and `git rm` aborted **without removing anything**, silently leaving the real plan doc in the branch. Paths are now read NUL-delimited from `git diff -z` in a `while IFS= read -r -d ''` loop into a bash array, and `git rm` is invoked once with that array, guarded by an array-length check. `xargs` is deliberately not used: the natural `grep -lZ | xargs -0` pairing breaks on macOS, where BSD `grep` does not NUL-terminate `-l` output. The loop form also avoids `mapfile -d`, which needs bash 4.4 while macOS ships bash 3.2. Tests execute the shipped shell block against a real git repository.
- **`create-pr.prompt.md` (Jira flow) now has a plan-doc removal step at all.** Previously the Jira orchestrator went straight from validations to `git push`, leaving the plan doc created by `work-ticket` / `create-plan` in the base branch after merge — a drift from the GitHub flow. New Step 5 mirrors the GitHub variant and commits before push; steps 5–7 renumbered to 6–8.
- **Documented the "subagent override filename must match the built-in name" rule** in `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and inline in `Explore.md`. Claude Code loads `.claude/agents/<name>.md` by filename stem, so renaming `Explore.md` to `explore.md` or any kebab-case variant registers a *new* subagent instead of overriding the built-in one — silently leaving the built-in on its default tier and defeating the pin. An explicit exception to the repo's kebab-case convention.
- **`model:` pin semantics corrected wherever they were overstated.** The pin **wins over** the Copilot picker and Claude `/model` — both are consulted only when no pin is set — so guidance suggesting a per-run switch via picker or `/model` was not executable. Every such passage (the `resolve-github-reviews` header, the `sonnet` → `opus` section in `CLAUDE.md`, the `core-review` escalation notes) now says what actually works: edit the installed file's `model:` line and revert afterward.
- **"The delegate's pin wins for that turn" qualified per platform.** True on Claude Code, where skills and slash-commands each establish a `model:` boundary. On Copilot, skills inherit the invoking prompt's model, so an inline `core-review` from a smart-tier orchestrator runs smart — invoke `@core-review` (if installed) or use a standalone chat to keep it cheap. On Codex the whole session runs one model. Corrected in all four root docs, the prompts README, and `core-review/SKILL.md`.
- **`core-review/SKILL.md` documents the expected VS Code linter warning** on its `model:` pin. VS Code's `chat-customizations-evaluations` extension flags `model:` as an unsupported *skill* attribute and surfaces it in the Problems panel. The pin is kept because Claude Code honours it per-turn on the cycle's most frequent delegate; the warning is cosmetic. A comment after the frontmatter records the trade-off.
- **Removed a dangling code comment** referencing the deleted `docs/subagent-cost-optimization-plan.md` design doc that had shipped in the npm package.

### Notes

- **Backward compatible, but not content-identical.** Prompts install through the same code paths on every agent, and assets keep working where `model:` is ignored (Codex today, older Copilot and Claude Code releases). No configuration file is required or read. The prompt *bodies* did change, though: each gains a `**Model:**` header line, the three plan generators now instruct writing the planning-doc marker, and `create-pr` / `create-github-pr` carry a rewritten planning-doc removal plus new staging and clean-worktree steps. The CLI gains one new flag (`--no-agent-overrides`). Existing files are unchanged until you run `update`; a Claude `update` then also writes `.claude/agents/Explore.md` (the cheap-tier override) unless `--no-agent-overrides` is passed. An `update` also rewrites prompt bodies, not just a single frontmatter line.
- **Measurement follow-up.** After this ships, run a 5-working-day window with 2 heavy users (one primarily on Claude Code, one on Copilot). Per user per day: input/output tokens, prompts invoked by tier, and cheap-tier failures (tasks re-run on the smart tier). **Demotion policy:** a prompt that fails ≥ 2 of 5 runs on the same class of task moves back to the smart tier in a patch release. No attempt at a perfect up-front classification.
- **86 tests passing** across `src/cli.test.js` and `src/validate-prompts.test.js`, including the Claude alias remap, byte-identical Copilot installs, the scalar-pin guard, `Explore` install/skip, `--budget` wiring, the marker-based plan-doc removal (both directions, plus the no-marker path), and a guard that the generators still emit the marker.

- **Local quality gate** ([#45](https://github.com/SilverAssist/agents-toolkit/issues/45)) — `husky`, `lint-staged`, `prettier` and `markdownlint-cli2` as devDependencies, wired to a single `npm run check` (format check → markdownlint → prompt frontmatter → tests) that both CI and the `pre-push` hook invoke, so the two cannot drift. `pre-commit` refuses direct commits to `main`/`master` and runs `lint-staged`; both hooks no-op when `$CI` is set.
- **`markdownlint` over the whole repo** — the gap this issue was really about: `templates/` is the product and ships as Markdown, and nothing validated it. Brought the repo from **2,780 violations to 0** across 66 files, the bulk of it 59 fenced blocks that had no language tag — the exact rule the shipped `core-review` checklist tells consumers to enforce.
- **`scripts/validate-prompts.mjs`** — frontmatter shape check for `templates/shared/prompts/*.prompt.md`: the block must open on line 1 and close, `description` must be present and non-empty, scalar-only keys (`description`, `agent`, `model`, `name`) must not be lists, no duplicate keys, no tabs. The scalar rule encodes a real failure: GitHub Copilot CLI rejects a `model:` array outright. Requiring `tools:` is deliberately left to the tools-scoping work, which adds the declarations and flips `REQUIRED_KEYS` in the same change — only 4 of 19 prompts declare it today.
- **CI `compat` matrix** — installs with `--omit=dev`, builds `dist/` first, then exercises the CLI and test suite on Node 22 and 24. This keeps `engines.node: >=22.0.0` an actually-verified claim.

### Changed (quality gate)

- **Prettier is scoped to `.js`/`.json`/`.yml` and never runs on Markdown.** It rewrites code spans whose exact whitespace is the subject of the surrounding sentence, which is a live hazard in templates that document frontmatter and shell snippets character by character.
- **`MD029` (ordered-list numbering) and `MD007` (list indentation) are disabled** — for their `--fix` behaviour, not their intent. Renumbering a list silently broke prose in `nextjs-caching/SKILL.md` that cites items as "strategy 1/2/3", and re-indenting flattened nested bullets into siblings. `MD013` and `MD060` are off as noise; `MD024` is `siblings_only` (a changelog repeats section headings by design) and `MD010` ignores code blocks (sample output must survive byte-for-byte).
- **Removed a duplicated section from `_partials/pr-template.md`** — "PR Size Guidelines" appeared twice, and the two "PR Merge Checklist" copies differed only in their last item. Kept the richer variant and folded the tracker-specific lines into one checklist.
- **`create-plan.prompt.md` now fences its plan template** as a `markdown` block instead of delimiting it with `---`, which removes the ambiguity about whether the separator was part of the content and resolves the duplicate-H1 the linter flagged.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-07-26

### Added

- **`tsdoc-standards.instructions.md`** ([#31](https://github.com/SilverAssist/agents-toolkit/issues/31)) — TSDoc (not JSDoc) documentation standard for TypeScript, `applyTo: "**/*.{ts,tsx}"`: core rules (no `{type}` braces in `@param`/`@returns`, `@typeParam` over `@template`, `@packageDocumentation` over `@module`, inline interface-member docs), the allowed-tags table, comment templates (Server Action, React component, utility, file header), and forbidden JSDoc patterns. Ported from the canonical ruleset maintained in the Next.js repos. Registered in `INSTRUCTIONS` and categorized under the `react` stack (next to `typescript`).
- **`tsdoc-standards` skill** ([#31](https://github.com/SilverAssist/agents-toolkit/issues/31)) — on-demand deep reference for the instruction: the *why* (types belong in code, not comments), rationale per rule, generic (`@typeParam`) templates, a forbidden→fix table, and a review checklist. Registered in `SKILLS` under the `react` stack.
- **`resolve-github-reviews.prompt.md`** ([#31](https://github.com/SilverAssist/agents-toolkit/issues/31)) — prompt to **fetch → address → reply → resolve → verify `0` unresolved** GitHub PR review threads (Copilot or human) with exact `gh`/GraphQL commands: `reviewThreads` query filtered on `isResolved == false`, per-thread REST replies (with the `in_reply_to` fallback and PR-level acknowledgement for Copilot suppressed notes), and the GraphQL `resolveReviewThread` mutation (REST cannot resolve threads). Registered in `PROMPTS.utility` and `FILE_CATEGORIES.prompts` under `universal` + `github`.
- **`github-review-management` skill** ([#31](https://github.com/SilverAssist/agents-toolkit/issues/31)) — reference knowledge backing the prompt: the review submission vs review comment vs review thread data model, which API does what (GraphQL lists and resolves review *threads*, REST posts replies), copy-paste `resolveReviewThread`/verification snippets, Copilot-specific handling (suppressed notes, `isOutdated` threads, per-commit rounds), and a common-failures table. Registered in `SKILLS` and categorized under `github` + `universal` (excluded for `--tracker jira`).
- **`core-review` skill** ([#35](https://github.com/SilverAssist/agents-toolkit/issues/35)) — a whole-repo, pre-emptive consistency review run as a **read-only pass** at two points — **before opening a PR** and **before pushing fixes in response to a reviewer** — to preempt the multi-round Copilot loops seen in agents-toolkit #32 / jsdoc-to-tsdoc #7. Ships the reviewer checklist (docs↔code drift, invalid code examples, broken links, markdown hygiene, inventory/table completeness, shell-snippet robustness, lockfile/CI health), the per-agent run guidance (Copilot/Codex run the whole-repo pass inline; Claude Code may delegate it to a subagent), a **"highest-recall patterns"** section distilled from a real review round (reframe-propagation sweep, scope-vs-mechanism, claim-matches-diff, inventory sibling cross-check, commit-before-push), and the prioritized `severity | file:line | problem | suggested fix` output contract. Registered in `SKILLS` and categorized under `github` + `universal` (excluded for `--tracker jira`).

### Changed

- **`FILE_CATEGORIES` (`bin/cli.js`)** — added `tsdoc-standards` to `instructions.react` and `skills.react`; added `resolve-github-reviews` to `prompts.universal` + `prompts.github`; added a new `skills.github` tracker key (`github-review-management`, also in `skills.universal`) so `--tracker github` includes and `--tracker jira` excludes it.
- **Docs indexes** — `README.md` (instructions, skills, workflow-prompts tables + skill counts), `templates/shared/prompts/README.md`, `templates/shared/skills/README.md`, and the `templates/agents/AGENTS.md` curated asset map now list the new assets.
- **`FILE_CATEGORIES` (`bin/cli.js`)** ([#35](https://github.com/SilverAssist/agents-toolkit/issues/35)) — added `core-review` to `skills.github` + `skills.universal` (registered in `SKILLS`, `src/index.js`) so `--tracker github`/`all` include it and `--tracker jira` excludes it.
- **Pre-review integration** ([#35](https://github.com/SilverAssist/agents-toolkit/issues/35)) — `create-github-pr.prompt.md` gains a "Pre-PR core review" step before push; `resolve-github-reviews.prompt.md` and `finalize-github-pr.prompt.md` gain a "re-review the whole repo before pushing fixes" step — each pointing at the `core-review` skill. README skills table + tree counts (12→13), the skills README, and the `AGENTS.md` + `AGENTS.codex.md` asset maps list the new skill.
- **Planning-doc lifecycle** — the `work-github-issue` planning document is now removed at **PR creation** (`create-github-pr.prompt.md`) instead of at finalization, so it no longer merges into and accumulates in the base branch's `docs/`. `finalize-github-pr.prompt.md` now only verifies none linger. Removed the stale `docs/*-plan.md` files that had accumulated from earlier PRs.

## [2.5.1] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed

- **`caching.instructions.md` / `nextjs-caching` skill — corrected the POST-read caching claim** (WEB-1069). The previous guidance implied `next: { revalidate, tags }` alone was sufficient to make a POST-read page (e.g. CCDS `geo-search`, which powers city/community pages) CDN-cacheable. Production testing showed the **data** fetch caches with those options, but the **route** still renders dynamically (`cache-control: private, no-store`) — the two are independent. Both documents now separate the data-fetch cache fact from the route-rendering fact and document the three fixes: CDN edge override (`proxy.ts`, shipped default), `dynamic = "force-static"` (interim, requires null-safety + throw-on-5xx), and `cacheComponents` + `use cache` (strategic).
- **Revalidate tiers raised to 30 days; image `minimumCacheTTL` to 1 year** in both documents — CCDS/WP data changes rarely and is refreshed on-demand via webhooks + tags, so the previous 24h/30d defaults were unnecessarily short.
- **Documented the `expireTime` / CDN stale-window rule** — Next emits `s-maxage=<revalidate>, stale-while-revalidate=<expireTime - revalidate>` for ISR pages, so `expireTime` must be ≥ the largest page `revalidate` or the stale window is invalid. Added the correct value (`5184000`, 60d) and the matching proxy override value (`s-maxage=2592000, stale-while-revalidate=2592000`) so ISR and edge-overridden dynamic pages present one consistent CDN policy.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- **`caching.instructions.md`** — Next.js (App Router) caching standards for Silver Side frontends: cache by read-vs-mutation intent (not HTTP method) so POST reads such as CCDS `geo-search` cache cross-request, `revalidate` + `tags` requirements, ISR tiers, dual Next.js/CloudFront on-demand invalidation, and image/asset-proxy TTLs. Registered in `INSTRUCTIONS` and categorized under the `react` stack.
- **`seo-ai-optimization.instructions.md`** — SEO & AI optimization patterns for Next.js: semantic HTML, accessibility tree quality for browser agents, `generateMetadata`, JSON-LD schema by page type, CLS prevention, and server-rendered content for AI Search visibility. Completes the AI-SEO set alongside the existing `ai-seo-optimization` skill and `audit-ai-seo` prompt. Registered in `INSTRUCTIONS` and categorized under the `react` stack.
- **`nextjs-caching` skill** — deep caching reference and decision guide: the five caching layers, the read-vs-mutation rule, why a `POST` read caches with `next: { revalidate, tags }` (Next 16 `patch-fetch` behavior + body-keyed cache), canonical client, ISR tiers, dual Next.js/CloudFront invalidation, anti-patterns, and a "page is not cached" diagnosis flow. Registered in `SKILLS` under the `react` stack.
- **`release-node.md` / `release-wordpress.md` partials** ([#27](https://github.com/SilverAssist/agents-toolkit/issues/27)) — ecosystem-specific release mechanics (version source of truth, bump commands, quality checks) consumed by `prepare-github-release`. Categorized under the `react` and `wordpress` stacks respectively in `FILE_CATEGORIES.partials`.

### Changed

- **`AGENTS.md` template** — documentation index now lists `caching` and `seo-ai-optimization`; added a "Caching Rules (CRITICAL)" quick-reference block and "When to Read" rows so every project gets the caching/SEO context at the agent-onboarding level.
- **Prompts enriched with caching context** — `review-code` gained a "Caching & Data Fetching" review section (catches the POST-read-uncached regression), `create-plan` gained a "Caching Impact" planning subsection, and the shared `validations` partial gained a caching checklist item.
- **`prepare-release` → `prepare-github-release`** ([#27](https://github.com/SilverAssist/agents-toolkit/issues/27)) — **breaking (command renamed)**. The prompt is now **project-agnostic**: it auto-detects WordPress plugin vs Node/npm package (loading the matching `release-*` partial) and **analyzes the repo's GitHub Actions workflows** to decide whether a bare tag or a full GitHub Release is required — fixing the wrong "push the tag and it publishes" guidance for `on: release:`-triggered workflows. Renamed in `PROMPTS.workflow`; old `prepare-release` removed with no alias.
- **Documented our own release flow for agents** — added a "Release Flow" section to the repo-level `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` and a "Version Sync (CRITICAL)" review check (#6) to `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, so all three agent-context surfaces (Claude, Copilot, generic) enforce the `package.json` ↔ `src/index.js` `VERSION` match and the "publish needs a GitHub Release, not a bare tag" rule.

### Fixed

- **`src/index.js` `VERSION` now matches `package.json`** — the exported `VERSION` (stamped into `agents-toolkit-lock.json` and used by `restore`/`status` drift checks) had diverged from the published package version during version bumps; bumped to `2.5.0` and added the guardrail above to prevent recurrence.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- **Skills lockfile support** ([#21](https://github.com/SilverAssist/agents-toolkit/issues/21)) — `install` now writes `agents-toolkit-lock.json` at the project root after each non-global, non-dry-run install. The lockfile records each skill's SHA-256 hash (same algorithm as `npx skills`) and agent dirs, enabling reproducible restores without committing skill files to the repository
- **`restore` command** — reads `agents-toolkit-lock.json`, reinstalls all skills + symlinks, and verifies hashes match the lockfile. Designed for post-clone setup and CI pipelines
- **`status` command** — compares installed skill hashes against the lockfile and prints a `up-to-date / modified / missing` table; exits with code `1` if any skill is out of sync (CI-friendly)
- **Auto `.gitignore` update** — `install` automatically appends `.agents/skills/`, `.github/skills/`, and `.claude/skills/` to `.gitignore` when those entries are not already present
- New `bin/cli.js` helpers: `computeSkillHash()`, `writeLockfile()`, `readLockfile()`, `appendSkillsToGitignore()`
- 10 new tests covering lockfile write, dry-run skip, global install skip, restore, and status (41 tests total)
- **`npx skills` standard for skills** ([#16](https://github.com/SilverAssist/agents-toolkit/issues/16)) — skills now install once into a canonical `.agents/skills/` store and each agent's skills directory symlinks to it (single source of truth shared across Copilot, Claude Code, and Codex)
- `--copy` CLI flag — materialize real copies instead of symlinks; symlinks also fall back to copies automatically when unsupported (e.g. Windows without developer mode)
- New `bin/cli.js` helpers: `getAgentsSkillsDir()`, `linkSkill()`, `installSkillsStandard()`
- `SKILLS_LAYOUT` export and `CLAUDE_FILES.skillsDir` in `src/index.js`
- Six new regression tests covering canonical store, per-agent symlinks, shared source of truth, `--copy`, stack filtering, and dry-run (30 tests total)
- **GitHub-specific PR prompts** — `create-github-pr` and `finalize-github-pr` complete the GitHub workflow pair alongside the existing `analyze-github-issue` / `work-github-issue`, using `{issue-number}` and `gh` CLI instead of Jira ticket IDs
- `FILE_CATEGORIES.prompts.github` extended with `create-github-pr` and `finalize-github-pr` — `--tracker github` now correctly includes/excludes all four GitHub prompt pairs
- Developer workflow prompts: `.github/prompts/` (prompts for Copilot/Codex) and `.claude/commands/` (commands for Claude Code) are real files decoupled from `templates/shared/prompts/` — project-specific and adapted for this Node.js ESM CLI repo
- Developer skills: `.agents/skills/` canonical store (4 Node.js-adapted skills) with `.github/skills/` and `.claude/skills/` symlinks

### Changed

- **Claude Code skills now install to `.claude/skills/`** (where Claude Code reads them natively) instead of `.github/skills/`
- README and skills template README document the `npx skills` standard, the `.agents/skills/` canonical store, and the `--copy` flag

### Fixed

- Claude Code users previously received skills in `.github/skills/`, a location Claude Code does not read — skills are now placed where the agent loads them

## [2.3.1] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- Hook commands failed at runtime with `/bin/sh: scripts/<name>.sh: No such file or directory` ([#17](https://github.com/SilverAssist/agents-toolkit/issues/17)). Copilot runs a hook `command` from the workspace root, not the hooks directory, so the relative `scripts/<name>.sh` path did not resolve — most visible on global (`~/.copilot/hooks/`) installs
- `installHooks()` now sets a `cwd` on each hook entry: `.github/hooks` (relative, portable) for project installs and the absolute hooks path for global installs, so the `command` resolves correctly
- Hook configs now declare the required `version: 1` field

### Note

- Existing installs must be refreshed to pick up the fix: `npx @silverassist/agents-toolkit@latest install --hooks-only --global --force` (or without `--global` for project-level hooks)

## [2.3.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- PostToolUse hooks system — automated validation and formatting after Copilot/Codex file edits
- `validate-tsx` hook — validates TSX component conventions (kebab-case folders, `index.tsx` naming, default export, Props interface)
- `lint-format` hook — runs ESLint `--fix` and Prettier `--write` on modified files automatically
- `--hooks-only` CLI flag for `install` command — installs only hook configs and scripts
- `installHooks()` function with script chmod and dry-run support
- `HOOKS` export array in `src/index.js`

## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added

- New `ai-seo-optimization` skill — comprehensive AI Search optimization knowledge base (semantic HTML, E-E-A-T, structured data, agent-friendly UX patterns)
- New `audit-ai-seo` prompt — on-demand 6-area audit with scoring output template (🟢/🟡/🔴)
- Registered `ai-seo-optimization` in SKILLS export array

## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- `--global` / `-g` flag for `install` and `update` commands — installs to `~/.copilot/` for user-level availability across all projects
- Global config support: `~/.agents-toolkit.json` is created automatically and used as fallback when no project-level config exists
- Config resolution cascade: CLI flags → project `.agents-toolkit.json` → global `~/.agents-toolkit.json` → defaults
- Two new regression tests for `--global` flag and help output (17 tests total)

### Changed

- Project-level files (`AGENTS.md`, `copilot-instructions.md`) are skipped when installing with `--global` since they are project-specific
- README updated with Global Install section, updated CLI reference table, and command comparison

### Fixed

- Renamed `.copilot-prompts.json` to `.agents-toolkit.json` in the repository root (config file was already using the new name in code)
- Updated `.npmignore` to exclude `.agents-toolkit.json` instead of the old `.copilot-prompts.json`

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-04

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Package renamed from `@silverassist/copilot-prompts-kit` to `@silverassist/agents-toolkit`
- **BREAKING**: CLI binary renamed from `copilot-prompts` to `agents-toolkit`
- **BREAKING**: Config file renamed from `.copilot-prompts.json` to `.agents-toolkit.json`
- Restructured `templates/` directory: shared content in `templates/shared/`, agent-specific root files in `templates/agents/`
- Eliminated ~28 duplicate files by consolidating instructions, prompts, and skills into single source of truth
- `pr-template.md` partial rewritten with dual-format support (GitHub Issues + Jira)

### Added

- `--stack <react|wordpress|all>` CLI flag to filter content by tech stack
- `--tracker <github|jira|all>` CLI flag to filter content by issue tracker
- `stack` and `tracker` fields in `.agents-toolkit.json` for persistent configuration
- GitHub issue workflow prompts: `analyze-github-issue`, `work-github-issue`
- GitHub integration partial: `_partials/github-integration.md`
- PHP/WordPress instructions: `php-standards`, `wordpress-plugin-architecture`, `testing-standards`
- Documentation & workflow instructions: `documentation-language`, `github-workflow`
- WordPress prompts: `new-wp-component`, `new-wp-plugin`, `prepare-release`, `quality-check`
- WordPress skills: `create-component`, `plugin-creation`, `quality-checks`, `release-management`, `testing`

### Fixed

- Remove identity replacement in `adaptPathsForClaude()` that replaced `.github/instructions/` with itself (CodeQL CWE-116)
- Use portable `import type { SyntheticEvent, ChangeEvent } from "react"` in react-components instructions instead of `React.` namespace that requires `esModuleInterop`

### Migration

To upgrade from v1.x:

```bash
# Old usage:
npx @silverassist/copilot-prompts-kit@latest install

# New usage:
npx @silverassist/agents-toolkit@latest install
```

If you have a `.copilot-prompts.json`, rename it to `.agents-toolkit.json`.

  - `add-tests` component import pattern (`default` export)
  - `work-ticket` branch creation based on configured base branch
- Updated `AGENTS.md` templates to reflect script-aware quality gates and removed non-existent `manage_todo_list` requirement

- Updated npm test script to `node --test`

## [1.4.1] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed

- **Component export convention** — Resolved contradiction between `CLAUDE.md` and `.github/instructions` files where `CLAUDE.md` required named exports (`export function`) but both instruction files required default exports (`export default function`)
- Updated all affected template files distributed via npm:
  - `templates/claude/CLAUDE.md` — Component Export Pattern section
  - `templates/AGENTS.md` — Component rules table and hook placement example
  - `templates/prompts/_partials/documentation.md` — JSDoc component example
  - `templates/skills/component-architecture/SKILL.md` — Props and hook placement examples
- Added barrel re-export pattern (`export { default as X }`) to component export examples

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
